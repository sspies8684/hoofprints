Building and Running Hoofprints
-------------------------------


Dependencies
============

 * Java 6 JDK
 * Apache Ant
 * build-essentials for compiling quagga & BIRD

Quick Start
===========

Let's assume you simply want to test Quagga on your local machine. 

First of all bootstrap the java files:
$ ant -f tasks/bootstrap.xml

To configure the test network open the file * conf/network.xml * 
There you should check, if the supplied configuration does not overlap with 
your local configuration.

If you made any changes to the file above, please open * conf/quagga.xml * and 
edit the file accordingly.

If you decide that it's time to setup the network run the following commands:
$ ant -f tasks/build.xml setupAddresses
$ ant -f tasks/build.xml setupQuaggaAddress


Go to the hoofprints root directory and type the following:
$ ant -f tasks/build.xml compileQuagga

When this script has finished, there should be a new installation of Quagga in
tmp/build/quagga-0.99.15. Please verify that Quagga has been installed to the 
right place.

Now compile Hoofprints:
$ ant -f tasks/build.xml compile



Now you're ready to go:

To run a testcase that connects a lot of clients, type:
$ ant -f tasks/build.xml T1

To send a lot of prefixes, type:
$ ant -f tasks/build.xml T2
